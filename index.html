         <h1>why choose us</h1>
         At Strong Tower Academy, we take your ward through an educational
experience that is both inciting and exciting.

We have a track record of raising children who are spiritually reverent, academically sound, and also socially outgoing.

We use a 21st century hybrid curriculum (British, American, Christian Accelerated, and Nigerian) that equals the best anywhere in the world.

We have a niche for academic excellence, yet a soft landing for our learners to learn and develop at their own pace.

Our social and co-curricular activities make us a theatre of dreams and an arena for champions who canâ€™t wait for the next school day.

</div>

<div>Settings that Encourage Learning
    Our facilities, top-notch activities, kind teachers, and personalised instruction are all intended to support our children's academic and personal success.
    
    Quality of Staffing and Teaching
    We have a pool of qualified, trained and all rounded staff, who are passionate about exposing our learners to an unlimited learning experience within and outside the classroom.
    
    A Home away from Home
    We understand that the school is a child's second home. Thus, our school activities ( academic and co-curricular ) are deliberately fun, diverse, and interesting, such that the memory sings of them till the next school day.</div>
